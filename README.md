# SQL - Project

In this project, the focus was on exploring a movie rentals database. The student's tasks involved running SQL queries and creating visualizations to display the query results.

For the presentation, the student had to prepare four slides, each with a specific question of interest. Each slide needed to include the question, the corresponding SQL query, a visualization using the query data, and a brief summary of the findings.


# Bikeshare Data Analysis

This project is a Python program that analyzes bikeshare data from three cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

## Introduction

Bikeshare Data Analysis is a command-line program that allows users to explore and gain insights from bikeshare data in three major cities in the United States. The program provides various statistics and visualizations, helping users understand the patterns and trends related to bike usage.

The main features of the program include:
- Filtering data by city, month, and day of the week to narrow down the analysis scope.
- Displaying popular times of travel, most frequently used stations, and common trip combinations.
- Calculating trip duration statistics, such as total travel time and average trip duration.
- Providing user information, including user types and gender breakdown (if available).
- Allowing users to view raw data to explore individual trip details.

The goal of this project is to provide a user-friendly tool for exploring bikeshare data and gaining valuable insights into bike usage patterns in different cities.


## Dependencies

Before running the bikeshare program, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (version 3.x)
- Pandas (version 1.x)
- NumPy (version 1.x)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
