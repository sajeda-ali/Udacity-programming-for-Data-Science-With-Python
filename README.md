# Bikeshare Data Analysis

**Description:**

Bikeshare Data Analysis is a Python program that analyzes bikeshare data from three major cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The program allows users to explore and gain insights from the bikeshare data, providing various statistics and visualizations to understand bike usage patterns in each city.

**Files used:**

- `bikeshare.py`: The Python script that contains the main program logic for data analysis.
- `chicago.csv`: Data file containing bikeshare data for the city of Chicago.
- `new_york_city.csv`: Data file containing bikeshare data for New York City.
- `washington.csv`: Data file containing bikeshare data for Washington.

**Credits:**

The structure and initial version of the `bikeshare.py` script were inspired by the Udacity Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree Program.
